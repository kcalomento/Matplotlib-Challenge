# üß¨ Pymaceuticals Inc. - SCC Treatment Study üß¨

Welcome to **Pymaceuticals Inc.**, where we tackle cancer research with data-driven insights! This project explores various drug regimens to treat **squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)** in mice, with a focus on uncovering the efficacy of different treatments, including some potential star drugs like **Capomulin** and **Ramicane**. Get ready to dive deep into data and discover some interesting findings!

## üìä Project Overview

The Pymaceuticals project analyzes a dataset of SCC treatment regimens tested on mice. We explore:
- **Overall Drug Efficacy**: Comparing tumor reduction across drug regimens, focusing on promising treatments.
- **Gender-Based Analysis**: Investigating if treatment outcomes vary by gender.
- **Tumor Volume Over Time**: Tracking tumor volume reduction for individual mice.
- **Weight and Tumor Volume Correlation**: Understanding the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume for tailored treatment insights.

Through this analysis, we aim to support drug efficacy research and pave the way for optimized SCC treatments. 

## üß∞ Installation

To run this analysis locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/pymaceuticals.git` and then `cd pymaceuticals`

2. **Install the required libraries**: This project uses Python, so make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**: Start Jupyter Notebook to open and interact with the project‚Äôs code using `jupyter notebook`

## üöÄ Usage

1. Open `pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow along with the code cells to reproduce the analysis.
3. Review insights on drug efficacy, gender differences, tumor volume trends, and weight correlation with tumor volume.

## üî¨ Analysis Highlights

Here‚Äôs a sneak peek at some of the cool things you‚Äôll find in this project:

### 1. **Drug Regimen Comparison** 
   - **Capomulin and Ramicane** emerged as the top contenders for reducing tumor size, showing lower average tumor volumes than other treatments.
   - **Infubinol** had some wild outliers, indicating inconsistent effects across mice.

### 2. **Gender Distribution and Impact** 
   - Our sample was almost evenly split by gender, reducing bias.
   - While there were slight differences in tumor volume by gender under Capomulin, more research is needed to confirm if gender affects treatment outcomes.

### 3. **Tumor Volume Over Time** 
   - Tumor volume tracked over time for a sample mouse treated with Capomulin showed consistent reduction, showcasing its potential as an effective treatment.

### 4. **Mouse Weight and Tumor Volume Correlation** 
   - Heavier mice tend to have slightly larger tumor volumes on average. This insight could inform customized dosing strategies for Capomulin based on weight.

## üìà Visualizations 

The analysis is packed with graphs, including:
- **Bar charts** and **pie charts** to illustrate data distribution.
- **Box plots** to show tumor volume variability and detect outliers.
- **Line plots** for tracking tumor volume over time.
- **Scatter plots** with regression lines to highlight correlations.

## üìù Conclusion and Future Directions

Our findings suggest that **Capomulin and Ramicane are the leading candidates for effective SCC treatment**. We also noticed potential effects of gender and weight on treatment efficacy, hinting at the value of personalized treatment plans. Future studies with larger sample sizes could expand on these insights and fine-tune dosing strategies for optimal results.
