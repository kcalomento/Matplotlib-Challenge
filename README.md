# 🧬 Pymaceuticals Inc. - Your Inside Look at SCC Treatment Discoveries! 

Welcome to the **Pymaceuticals SCC Treatment Study**! This project is all about uncovering the most effective drug regimens for **squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)** in the furry test subjects. Get ready to explore data like a scientist as we test star drugs like **Capomulin** and **Ramicane**—together, we’ll see what works, what doesn’t, and what might just change the future of SCC treatment!

## 📊 Project Overview

Think of this as your very own lab exploration! Here’s what we’ll be diving into:

- **Drug Efficacy**: Which treatments pack the biggest punch in shrinking tumors?
- **Gender Analysis**: Could male and female mice respond differently to treatment? Let's find out.
- **Tumor Volume Trends**: Follow tumor growth (or shrinkage!) over time and see how effective each treatment really is.
- **Weight & Tumor Volume Correlation**: Is there a relationship between a mouse’s weight and its tumor size? Join us as we investigate this clue for personalized medicine.

By the end, you’ll have a clear picture of which treatments hold the most promise and what factors might just make or break a regimen. Excited? Let’s dive in!

## 🧰 Installation

Let’s set up so you can explore the data yourself:

1. **Clone the repository**: Start by downloading the project with `git clone https://github.com/your-username/pymaceuticals.git` and then jump in with `cd pymaceuticals`.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python 3.x, then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to set up all the libraries we’ll be using.
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**: Open Jupyter Notebook with `jupyter notebook` to interact with the analysis.

## 🚀 Usage

Now it’s time to dive into the data:

1. Open up `pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow along with each cell to replicate the analysis—think of it as your lab manual!
3. See for yourself how these drugs perform, check out gender effects, watch tumor changes over time, and discover the relationship between weight and tumor size.

## 🔬 Analysis Highlights

Here’s a preview of the fascinating results you’re about to uncover:

### 1. **Star Drug Regimens**
   - **Capomulin** and **Ramicane** are the all-stars here, consistently showing the lowest average tumor volumes. Ready to see the data back them up?
   - **Infubinol** threw us a curveball with some outliers—let’s dig into the data to see what’s going on.

### 2. **Gender Insights**
   - The data is nearly split between male and female mice, which means the results are balanced.
   - Curious to know if treatment effects differ by gender? You’ll get a peek at some preliminary insights that may surprise you.

### 3. **Tracking Tumor Volume Over Time**
   - Follow the journey of a mouse treated with Capomulin as its tumor volume steadily decreases. Capomulin might just be the real deal—see it for yourself!

### 4. **Weight-Tumor Volume Connection**
   - Heavier mice seem to have slightly larger tumors, hinting that dosing based on weight could be a game-changer. Intrigued? You’re about to connect the dots.

## 📈 Visuals 

This analysis is full of visuals to make the data come to life:

- **Bar & Pie Charts**: Quick snapshots of data distribution and treatment breakdowns.
- **Box Plots**: See variability in tumor sizes and spot those odd outliers.
- **Line Plots**: Track tumor volume over time to see how different drugs perform.
- **Scatter Plots with Trend Lines**: Spot correlations, like weight vs. tumor volume, to uncover deeper insights.

## 📝 Final Takeaways

As you explore, you’ll see why **Capomulin and Ramicane stand out as promising SCC treatments**. The analysis also hints that gender and weight could influence how effective a treatment is. Imagine the possibilities with more research—this could be the first step toward personalized SCC treatments!
